I am a PhD in Computer Engineering, with a thesis focused on survivability of distributed Java systems through transparent replication middleware and secure communication protocols.

I spent over a decade in Motorola Labs developing advanced concepts for their next-generation mobile, television, wearable and public safety platforms. The work led to many refereed publications and patents (9 issued, 20+ pending) in areas including mobile ad hoc & sensor networks, device management, pervasive computing, context-aware frameworks, mobile advertising, social television, device ensembles and personal safety.

I am currently a software architect and consultant primarily focused on developing product concepts and MVP prototypes for early-stage startups targeting the mobile consumer. My projects have spanned real-time sports, mobile enterprise, social good and interactive media domains. I am a _machine learning_ and _internet of things_ enthusiast and currently engaged in a collaboration with university faculty and startups to explore projects with real-world applications for the local community.

I founded the Google Developer Group (GDG) in [Hudson Valley](https://www.meetup.com/gdg-hudson-valley/) and co-organize the GDG chapter in [New York City](https://www.meetup.com/gdgnyc/). Our focus here is on applied learning as it relates to emerging technologies in areas like machine learning, cloud computing, wearables, Android, progressive web apps, Internet of Things, analytics, smart assistants, cryptocurrency and more. I'm also the core organizer on [Android Camp](https://androidcamp.splashthat.com/) held in July 2016 as part of [Open Camps](http://opencamps.org/team.html) at the UN, and [DevFest NYC](http://devfestnyc.com), a 2-day developer conference in NYC.
