# Firebase Camp

Firebase is a platform from Google that started off as a real-time database, but morphed in 2016 into a comprehensive development, monetization and engagement platform to support mobile and web applications. This new release -- termed _Firebase v3_ -- will be the primary focus of **FirebaseCamp**.

FirebaseCamp is an initiative to support self-directed learning of core concepts, tools & libraries that are part of the Firebase platform. This includes sharing blog posts on development & design insights, reviewing relevant tutorials or content, and support in-person workshops (1-day) or study camps (multi-week) to grow the ecosystem of developers using Firebase for rapid prototyping, MVP or product development.



## Website Theme

_The Firebase Camp website is build using the [HydeJack](https://github.com/qwtel/hydejack) Jekyll theme and hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/)_
